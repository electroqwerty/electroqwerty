### My projects overview:

**COVID-19 Data Analysis - South Korea**

- Explored the dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis in South Korea using Python and visualization libraries. This project provided insights into trends and patterns that influenced public health strategies.

**Mental Health in Tech Industry**

- Analyzed survey data to identify trends in mental health issues within the tech industry, focusing on impact factors and support mechanisms.

**Apple Podcast Reviews Analysis**

- Utilized NLP techniques to analyze user reviews on Apple Podcasts, extracting sentiment trends and listener preferences.

**Red Wine Quality and Alcohol Content Prediction**

- Predictive modeling project using OLS method to determine quality and alcohol content of red wines based on their chemical properties. Demonstrated the relationship between various factors and wine quality.

**Football League Data Analysis**

- Deep dive into a dataset of over 25,000 football matches. Analyzed team performance and match outcomes using logistic and random forest models.

**Travel Insurance Prediction**

- Developed a machine learning model to predict insurance buying behavior based on customer demographics and sales data.

**Stroke Prediction**

- Employed CatBoost and LightGBM to predict stroke likelihood, achieving high recall rates. This project highlighted the potential of machine learning in healthcare applications.

**Lending Club Loan Status Prediction**

- Analyzed lending data to predict loan default risks using CatBoost, helping in risk assessment for financial institutions.

**Risk Evaluation for Banks**

- Built models to predict customer defaults using machine learning, assisting banks in their risk management strategies.

**Deep Learning Projects:**
