## üöÄ About Me

AI researcher and developer with hands-on experience building AI applications and conducting machine learning research. Currently working as a student researcher at **Jo≈æef Stefan Research Institute** in Ljubljana, developing document analysis tools using Large Language Models (LLMs). 

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between AI research and practical applications, with a strong foundation in both classical machine learning and modern AI technologies.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Other Interests

- **Long-term humanity prosperity and catastrophic risks:** I am intellectually driven towards complex consequences of modern human way of life and its implications on our long term survival. Our blindness to finite resources and expectations of exponential growth, our toolmaking capabilities and development of advanced AI's, financial system blindness to energy and more.

- **Technology and Society:** Improving technology usage to minimize negative externalities. Finding frameworks of developing positive externality tech.

- **Alternative political and economic theories**: Small governments and subsidiarity. I tend towards libertarian and free market approaches, while paradoxically realizing we need more regulation of powerful tech as we had none of those in the past.

- **Podcasts** I am quite a podcast listener, I fell in love with this medium of information consumption. From health, tech, entertainment or politics, I turn to podcasts for primary information from experts. Unmediated access in long form is amazing. Some of my podcast suggestions: [Huberman Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab), [JRE](https://www.youtube.com/@joerogan), [Theories of Everything with Curt Jaimungal](https://www.youtube.com/@TheoriesofEverything), [The Great Simplification](https://www.youtube.com/@thegreatsimplification), [Dark Horse](https://www.youtube.com/@DarkHorsePod), [Drive - Peter Attia](https://www.youtube.com/@PeterAttiaMD/featured), [Found My Fitness](https://www.youtube.com/@FoundMyFitness/videos).

- **Techno music:** I've bonded with this music unexpectedly few years back, and I am enjoying it more as time goes by. One of my goals for near future is to learn how to mix and become an amateur DJ. I want to bring complete immersion to the audience.

- **Exercise, fitness and longevity:** Recently I've been more and more interested in optimizing my health through exercise and healthy habits, I started exercising routinely at the beginning of this year and find it hard to stop. These interests are fueled by ungodly amount of health related podcasts. Exercising is becoming more and more exciting to me as I progress.

- **Cybersecurity and digital privacy**: Proponent of privacy online, I am quite unhappy with the current state of things with regards to personal data and big tech. Over the years I've gathered many useful practical approaches to privacy online. I quite dislike the extent to which social media companies have intruded our personal spaces. I strongly encourage people to switch to FOSS variants of all software they use. I will finish this part with a quote from Edward Snowden: "Ultimately, arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."
